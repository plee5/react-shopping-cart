Keep your answers to each checkoff question here for safe keeping. You will need to copy them over to the submission form at the end of the project. 

1.1) ReactDOM.render is telling the computer to look for the Cart and render whatever is there into the div component in the HTML code.

1.2) Using Semantic UI means that we can abstract out the CSS for creating the car and just call the Semantic UI components and know what it will do for us.

1.3) We need to wrap addToCart in another function so that when we do click, it won't just immediately call the function and then do nothing else. By wrapping it in another function, we can repeatedly call this function.
